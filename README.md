TITLE:FLASHLIGHT APP
ANDROID STUDIO

## Description

The Flashlight App for Android.
It provides a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy to access instant light whenever you need it. 
Whether you're looking for something in the dark, walking at night, or facing a power outage, this app is your reliable companion.
The Flashlight App is a simple mobile application that turns on the device's flashlight when the app is launched and turns it off when the app is closed or paused. It provides a single-screen layout with a toggle button to control the flashlight. The app checks for the availability of a camera flash on the device and implements code to turn on and off the flashlight based on the user's input. Additionally, error handling is implemented to handle scenarios where the device doesn't have a camera flash or if the flashlight fails to turn on.

**Important**: This app requires a device with a camera flash to function as a flashlight.

## Features

- Turn on the flashlight with a single tap
- Turn off the flashlight with a single tap
- Error handling for devices without a camera flash or flashlight failure
- Proper handling of app lifecycle events to ensure the flashlight is turned off when the app is closed or paused
